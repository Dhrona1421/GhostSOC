# GhostSOC — UML & Architecture Documentation

**Repository analyzed:** `https://github.com/Dhrona1421/GhostSOC` (default branch `main`, cloned for this analysis)
**Note on the requested URL:** the prompt referenced `Dhrona1421/GhostSOCadvanced`, which returns HTTP 404 and does not appear to exist. The user subsequently confirmed the correct repository is `Dhrona1421/GhostSOC`, which is the repository this document analyzes.

All diagrams and claims below are derived directly from the source in this repository (`README.md`, `docs/*.md`, `backend/app/**`, `frontend/src/**`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `backend/tests/**`). Anything that could not be confirmed from the code is explicitly labeled **"Not confirmed from repository"**. The project's own README uses a "truthful status" framing (it distinguishes implemented, boundary/optional, and mocked components), and this documentation preserves that distinction rather than smoothing it over.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

GhostSOC is a self-contained **Security Operations Center (SOC) dashboard and safe-response orchestrator**. It is a two-tier web application: a **FastAPI (Python) backend** backed by **PostgreSQL** (source of truth) and **OpenSearch** (best-effort search index), fronted by a **React (Vite) single-page application** served through **Nginx**. The whole stack is defined as a **Docker Compose** project with four core services (`postgres`, `opensearch`, `backend`, `frontend`) plus two optional demo-runner containers.

The system ingests normalized endpoint/network telemetry and allowlisted web-traffic records, evaluates them against a small, deterministic **Sigma-compatible rule engine** and a **35-category web-attack catalog**, generates **Alerts**, deterministically **correlates** alerts into **Incidents** (4-hour host/IOC + MITRE technique bucketing), computes an **explainable risk score**, allows analysts to attach **evidence**, request **policy-gated response actions** (dry-run only by default), and **audits** every consequential action. Live updates reach the UI via **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**. Everything is guarded by **JWT authentication** and a three-role **RBAC** model (`ADMIN`, `ANALYST`, `VIEWER`) enforced in the backend, not just the UI.

A defining, explicitly documented architectural trait is **truthfulness about scope**: real external security products (Wazuh, Velociraptor, Arkime, MISP, OpenCTI, Shuffle, live CTI feeds) are represented only as configuration/health boundaries — GhostSOC never marks them "healthy" without a real check, and it never claims to have performed real containment. Response execution defaults to `DRY_RUN=true`.

## 2. Project Overview

| Attribute | Value (from repository) |
|---|---|
| Project name | **GhostSOC** |
| Purpose | Unified SOC dashboard + safe, policy-controlled security response orchestrator |
| Problem solved | Consolidates telemetry ingestion, Sigma-style detection, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, incident correlation, risk explanation, investigation, and *safe* (dry-run-first) response into one auditable system, instead of stitching together disparate SIEM/SOAR tools |
| Major features | Event ingestion & normalization; Sigma-compatible detection; 35-category web-attack detection; SSE live monitor; MITRE ATT&CK mapping; deterministic incident correlation; explainable risk scoring; SOC trend/attack-graph/network-topology/incident-relationship visualizations; global search; evidence collection; policy-gated response actions; audit trail; PDF/JSON/CSV/ZIP reporting; connector health registry; deterministic demo mode |
| Target users | Security Analyst, SOC Analyst/Administrator, System Administrator (implied by RBAC roles `ADMIN` / `ANALYST` / `VIEWER`), and API clients/telemetry sources feeding events |
| Major subsystems | Auth & RBAC; Event ingestion & normalization; Detection engine (Sigma + Web); Correlation & risk engine; Incident/investigation/evidence; Response orchestration; Audit; Reporting; Visualizations & search; Connector registry; Live/SSE broker |
| Technology stack | Python 3.11–3.13 / FastAPI / SQLAlchemy / Alembic / Pydantic / Argon2 / PyJWT (backend); React 18 + Vite + vanilla CSS (frontend); PostgreSQL 16 (or SQLite for dev/test); OpenSearch 2.19 (search adapter); Docker Compose; Nginx (frontend reverse proxy/static host) |
| Architectural style | Layered monolithic backend (API → services → SQLAlchemy models → PostgreSQL) with a decoupled SPA frontend, communicating over a JSON REST API plus one SSE stream. Not a microservices system. |
| Deployment model | Docker Compose, single-host, 4 core containers + 2 optional demo-profile containers; also supports non-container local development (`make run` + `npm run dev`) |
| External dependencies | PostgreSQL, OpenSearch (bundled containers); optionally Wazuh, Velociraptor, Arkime, MISP, OpenCTI, Shuffle, ThreatFox/URLhaus/MalwareBazaar (abuse.ch), AbuseIPDB, VirusTotal — all **boundary/optional**, never bundled |
| Database technology | PostgreSQL 16.4 (production/compose), SQLite (explicitly supported for local dev/tests only) |
| Frontend technology | React 18 (functional components + hooks), Vite build tool, plain CSS files, served by Nginx in production |
| Backend technology | FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2.0 ORM (Mapped/mapped_column style), Alembic migrations, Pydantic v2 schemas, Argon2id password hashing, PyJWT HS256 tokens |
| Security components | JWT bearer auth (+ optional cookie/dashboard-token paths), Argon2id hashing, backend-enforced RBAC, correlation-ID middleware, security response headers, CORS allowlist, SSRF-safe connector URL validation, target-authorization checks for response actions, secret redaction in web telemetry, audit logging |
| Monitoring/detection components | Sigma-compatible `DetectionRule` engine (`backend/app/services/detection.py`), 35-category web-attack catalog (`backend/app/web_catalog.py`) + `web_detection.py`, MITRE ATT&CK curated metadata (`backend/app/mitre.py`), `DetectionCoverage` table, SSE live broker |
| Containerization/deployment components | `docker-compose.yml` (postgres, opensearch, backend, frontend, demo-runner, web-demo-runner), `backend/Dockerfile`, `frontend/Dockerfile` + `frontend/nginx.conf` |

### Concise architectural summary

GhostSOC is a **3-tier, layered monolith**: React SPA → Nginx reverse proxy → FastAPI application (itself layered: middleware → routers → services → SQLAlchemy models) → PostgreSQL (authoritative) with OpenSearch as a best-effort side index. Detection, correlation, response, and reporting are implemented as **service modules** invoked from **API route handlers**, not as separate microservices or background workers — there is **no message queue and no distributed task runner** in this codebase (see §34, Accuracy Rules). Live updates are pushed via an **in-process SSE broker** (`EventBroker`), explicitly documented as non-authoritative and non-clustered.

## 5. System Architecture

### 5.1 High-level architecture (from `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, verified against code)

```plantuml
@startuml C5_HighLevelArchitecture
title GhostSOC — High-Level Architecture

skinparam componentStyle rectangle

actor "Browser / SOC Analyst" as Browser

package "Frontend tier" {
  component "Nginx :8080\n(non-root, serves React bundle,\nproxies /api/*)" as Nginx
}

package "Backend tier" {
  component "FastAPI :8000\n(middleware, routers, services)" as API
}

package "Data tier" {
  database "PostgreSQL\n(source of record)" as PG
  database "OpenSearch\n(best-effort index)" as OS
}

package "External / optional" {
  component "Connector adapters\n(Wazuh, Velociraptor, Arkime,\nMISP, OpenCTI, Shuffle, CTI feeds)" as Connectors
}

Browser --> Nginx : HTTPS/HTTP, relative /api requests
Nginx --> API : reverse proxy
API --> PG : SQLAlchemy (authoritative writes/reads)
API ..> OS : best-effort indexing (failure logged, not fatal)
API ..> Connectors : optional health checks / enrichment\n(never bundled, never faked healthy)

note bottom of PG
  Authoritative for identity, events, web
  requests, attacks, detections, incidents,
  evidence, response state, reports, audit.
end note
@enduml
```

### 5.2 Request flow (documented in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, matches `main.py` middleware)

1. Nginx serves the built React bundle and proxies relative `/api` calls to the backend (`frontend/nginx.conf`).
2. `request_context` middleware (`main.py`) assigns/validates `X-Correlation-ID`, times the request, and adds `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, and `Cache-Control` response headers.
3. `get_current_user` (`api/dependencies.py`) resolves identity from a Bearer JWT, an `X-GhostSOC-Token` header, or a `ghostsoc_session` cookie (with a tightly-gated demo-auto-access fallback).
4. `require_permission(...)` dependencies enforce RBAC per-route using the `ROLE_PERMISSIONS` table in `core/security.py` — **authorization is enforced server-side**, not just hidden in the UI.
5. Pydantic schemas (`schemas.py`, `web_schemas.py`) validate and bound request payloads.
6. SQLAlchemy persists to PostgreSQL (or SQLite in dev/test).
7. Errors return a uniform envelope: `{"error": {"code","message","correlation_id"}}` via three exception handlers in `main.py` (`HTTPException`, `RequestValidationError`, generic `Exception`).

---

## 6. Use Case Model

### 6.1 Actors (confirmed from RBAC table + API surface)

| Actor | Evidence |
|---|---|
| **Administrator** (`role=ADMIN`) | `ROLE_PERMISSIONS["ADMIN"]` — full permission set including `MANAGE_CONNECTORS`, `MANAGE_RULES`, `APPROVE_RESPONSE`, `VIEW_AUDIT` |
| **Security/SOC Analyst** (`role=ANALYST`) | `ROLE_PERMISSIONS["ANALYST"]` — `VIEW_EVENTS`, `MANAGE_INCIDENTS`, `RUN_INVESTIGATION`, `EXECUTE_RESPONSE`, `EXPORT_REPORTS`, `VIEW_AUDIT` |
| **Viewer** (`role=VIEWER`) | `ROLE_PERMISSIONS["VIEWER"] = {"VIEW_EVENTS"}` — read-only |
| **Telemetry/API Client** | POSTs to `/api/v1/events`, `/api/v1/events/telemetry/{source_type}`, `/api/v1/web/requests` |
| **External security products** (Wazuh, Velociraptor, Arkime, MISP, OpenCTI, Shuffle) | `connectors/registry.py` — health/boundary only, **not actors that perform use cases inside GhostSOC** |
| **CTI Providers** (ThreatFox, URLhaus, AbuseIPDB, MalwareBazaar, VirusTotal) | `connectors/cti.py` — invoked by `POST /threat-intelligence/enrich` |

No "System Administrator" distinct from `ADMIN` was found; the README's mention of "Administrator" maps directly to the `ADMIN` role. No generic "Monitoring System" actor beyond OpenSearch/connector health checks was found.

### 6.3 Selected use case detail

**UC10 — Request response action**
- Actor: Analyst or Administrator (permission `EXECUTE_RESPONSE`)
- Precondition: Incident exists; caller authenticated with a valid JWT
- Main flow: `POST /api/v1/response-actions` → `services/response.create_action()` validates action type against `ALLOWED_ACTIONS` (7 types), resolves an enabled `ResponsePolicy`, checks `incident.risk_level` against `policy.min_risk_level`, validates the target format per action type (`_validate_target`), and — if no approval is required — executes a **dry-run simulation** (`_execute_dry_run`), recording `execution_result.executed=false`.
- Alternative flow: If the action requires approval, the incident status becomes `CONTAINMENT_PENDING` and a second actor calls **UC11 — Approve/deny response** (`POST /response-actions/{id}/approval`).
- Postcondition: A `ResponseAction` row and an audit-log entry exist; the incident's status may change to `INVESTIGATING` (dry-run) or, only for a real, verified, non-dry-run adapter result, `CONTAINED`. **Real containment execution is not implemented** — any non-dry-run path deterministically fails closed (`"No real response adapter is configured; refusing execution"`).
- Related components: `api/routes.py` (`response_request`, `response_approval`), `services/response.py`, `models.ResponseAction`, `models.ResponsePolicy`.

**UC3 — Ingest security event → detect → correlate**
- Actor: Telemetry/API client
- Main flow: `POST /api/v1/events` (or `/events/telemetry/{source_type}`) → `services/ingestion.ingest_event()` persists a `SecurityEvent`, then calls `services/detection.detect_event()` (matches enabled Sigma-compatible rules field-by-field) which creates `Alert` rows, then `services/correlation.correlate_alert()` computes a deterministic correlation key and creates/joins an `Incident`, extracts IOCs, appends a `TimelineEvent`, and recomputes risk.
- Postcondition: Event, zero-or-more Alerts, and zero-or-one Incident (new or joined) persisted; IOCs attached to the incident.

**Frontend navigation model** (from `App.jsx`, `NAV_GROUPS`): the SPA is not a multi-route router (no React Router found); it is a single-page shell with client-side `page` state switching between: *Overview, Live Monitor, Alerts, Attacks, Web Security* (Monitor group); *Incidents, Threat Intelligence, Hosts, Detection Coverage, Hunt* (Investigate group); *Reports, Integrations, Audit, Settings* (Manage group). Each maps to a REST endpoint via the `pageEndpoint` lookup table.

## 9. Deployment Architecture

node "Host machine (Docker Engine + Compose v2)" {

  node "frontend container\n(nginx, non-root)\nport 8080:8080" as FE
  node "backend container\n(FastAPI/uvicorn, non-root)\nno published host port" as BE
  node "postgres container\n(postgres:16.4-alpine)\nno published host port" as PGN
  node "opensearch container\n(opensearchproject/opensearch:2.19.3)\nno published host port" as OSN

note right of BE
  Only /api/v1/health is published
  indirectly (no direct DB/search host ports —
  matches README "no direct database/search
  host ports" security default).
end note
@enduml
```

**Notes grounded in the compose file:**
- Only the **frontend** service publishes a host port (`8080:8080`); `backend`, `postgres`, and `opensearch` have **no `ports:` mapping**, confirming the README's "no direct database/search host ports" claim.
- `backend` has `depends_on: {postgres: service_healthy, opensearch: service_healthy}` — startup order is enforced via Compose healthchecks, not an external orchestrator.
- `demo-runner` / `web-demo-runner` only run under the `demo` or `full` Compose **profiles** and exit after one run (`restart: "no"`).
- All services set `security_opt: [no-new-privileges:true]`.
- **Kubernetes, Helm charts, or cloud-specific infrastructure-as-code were not found in the repository** — deployment is Docker Compose only. (Not confirmed from repository: any hosted/cloud deployment target.)

## 10. Backend Architecture (Layered)

```plantuml
@startuml BackendLayers
title GhostSOC — Backend Layered Architecture
skinparam componentStyle rectangle

component "API Layer\n(FastAPI routers: routes.py,\nweb_security.py, visualizations.py)" as L1
component "Dependency/Auth Layer\n(dependencies.py: JWT resolution,\nRBAC permission checks)" as L2
component "Service Layer\n(ingestion, detection, correlation,\nresponse, reporting, investigation,\naudit, search, realtime)" as L3
component "Data Access Layer\n(SQLAlchemy ORM models.py,\nSession via core/database.py)" as L4
database "PostgreSQL / SQLite" as L5

L1 --> L2
L1 --> L3
L2 --> L4
L3 --> L4
L4 --> L5
@enduml
```

Middleware sits above the router layer inside `main.py`: correlation-ID assignment, security headers, structured logging, and three global exception handlers (`HTTPException`, `RequestValidationError`, generic `Exception`) that all funnel through a single JSON error envelope.

**Startup sequence (`lifespan` in `main.py`):** on boot, the app opens a `SessionLocal()`, runs `seed_foundation(db)` (bootstrap admin user + default response policy — `core/bootstrap.py`), then `sync_rules(db)` (loads/validates Sigma-compatible YAML rules from `backend/rules/*.yml`) and `sync_web_rules(db)` (loads the 35 web-attack catalog entries as `DetectionRule` rows), logging the resulting rule counts.

---

## 11. Frontend Architecture

- **Entry point:** `main.jsx` mounts `<App />` into the DOM (React 18 `createRoot`, confirmed pattern; exact API not fully re-verified line-by-line beyond import structure).
- **Pages:** rendered conditionally inside `App.jsx` based on `page` state and the `NAV_GROUPS`/`pageEndpoint` tables — Overview, Live Monitor, Alerts, Attacks, Web Security, Incidents, Threat Intelligence, Hosts, Detection Coverage, Hunt, Reports, Integrations, Audit, Settings.
- **State management:** local React state via `useState`/`useMemo`/`useCallback`/`useRef` (from `App.jsx` imports). **No Redux, MobX, or other global state library was found.**
- **API client:** `api.js` exports `api` (a fetch wrapper, presumably attaching the JWT and base path) and `login()`. Exact request/response shaping was not further decompiled line-by-line here but the import surface confirms this is the single network boundary for the SPA.
- **Auth flow:** `Login` component (`App.jsx`) posts credentials via `login(email, password)`; on success, the app renders `Sidebar` + the selected page; sign-out is hidden entirely when `autoAccess` demo mode is active.
- **Live updates:** `LiveSecurity.jsx` consumes the backend SSE stream (`GET /api/v1/live/stream`) for the Live Monitor page.
- **Visualization primitives:** `GraphCanvas.jsx` is a shared SVG rendering component reused by `Visualizations.jsx` for the attack graph, network topology ("NetworkMode"), and incident relationship graph — consistent with the architecture doc's claim of "deterministic layouts, not long-running physics simulation."

## 12. Database Architecture & Entity Relationship Diagram

Alembic migrations (`backend/alembic/versions/`) create exactly these tables, matching `models.py` 1:1: `users`, `connector_states`, `security_events`, `web_requests`, `detection_rules`, `alerts`, `attack_detections`, `incidents`, `iocs`, `evidence`, `timeline_events`, `response_policies`, `response_actions`, `audit_logs`, `reports`, `detection_coverage`. Two migrations exist: `673a0121be01_initial_ghostsoc_schema.py` (base schema) and `3f1186d33919_add_web_security_monitoring.py` (adds `web_requests` / `attack_detections` and related web-security columns).

| Password hashing | Argon2id, `time_cost=2, memory_cost=19456, parallelism=1`, min length 12 (`core/security.py`) |
| Tokens | JWT HS256, `iss=ghostsoc`, `aud=ghostsoc-api`, short expiry (`access_token_minutes`, default 60) (`core/security.py`) |
| RBAC | 3 roles × explicit permission sets, enforced via FastAPI `Depends(require_permission(...))` (`core/security.py`, `api/dependencies.py`) |
| Production hardening | `Settings.secure_production_defaults()` validator rejects production boot if: `demo_auto_access` on, weak/default `secret_key`, default admin password unchanged, `demo_mode` on, or insecure session cookie (`core/config.py`) |
| Response-action target validation | Regex/allowlist checks per action type (`services/response.py: _validate_target`) — rejects control characters/shell metacharacters, requires authorized hosts, requires IOC already attached to the incident, or a well-formed SHA-256 for file targets |
| Idempotency | `idempotency_key` unique constraint prevents duplicate response-action execution (`models.ResponseAction`, `services/response.create_action`) |
| SSRF protection on connectors | `connectors/base.py: validate_connector_url()` resolves DNS and rejects private/loopback/link-local/reserved IPs unless `GHOSTSOC_ALLOW_PRIVATE_CONNECTORS=true`; also rejects embedded credentials in URLs |
| Web telemetry sanitization | `services/web_detection.py`: header allowlist (`SAFE_HEADER_NAMES`), secret redaction regex, `session_hash` instead of raw session ID |
| CORS | `CORSMiddleware` restricted to configured origins, methods limited to `GET, POST, PATCH, OPTIONS` (`main.py`) |
| Response headers | `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`, `Cache-Control: no-store` on `/api/*` (`main.py`) |
| No command execution surface | No endpoint accepts arbitrary shell/SQL; `services/response.py` uses an allowlist of 7 typed actions, always ending in `DRY_RUN` unless a real adapter exists (none does) |
| Container hardening | `security_opt: no-new-privileges:true` on all services; non-root Nginx and backend images (per README; Dockerfiles set non-root users) |

```

**Detection rule format (Sigma-compatible subset):** each YAML rule (`backend/rules/*.yml`) must contain `title`, `id`, `description`, `detection`, `level`. The `detection.condition` supports **only** named selections joined by `and`/`or` with `equals`, `contains`, `startswith`, `endswith` modifiers — parentheses and `|` (pipe) chains are explicitly rejected by `validate_rule()` (`services/detection.py`). This is a deliberately restricted, deterministic subset of Sigma, not a full Sigma implementation. Three bundled rules exist: `cowrie_shell_activity.yml`, `suricata_high_alert.yml`, `suspicious_powershell.yml`.

**Web attack catalog:** 35 categories (`web_catalog.py`), each a `WebAttackDefinition` with `number`, `slug`, `name`, `family`, `severity`, `base_confidence`, `detection_mode` (e.g., `SIGNATURE_OR_SIGNAL`, `CONTEXT_SIGNAL`, `BEHAVIORAL`), MITRE technique tuple, and regex `patterns`. Categories span injection (SQLi, XSS, command injection, SSTI, XXE), access control (IDOR, CSRF, business-logic abuse), credential attacks (brute force, credential stuffing, password spraying, session hijacking), API/protocol attacks (GraphQL, WebSocket, JWT, HTTP smuggling/parameter pollution), and infrastructure misconfigurations (CORS, cache poisoning/deception, host-header injection, open redirect). The README explicitly notes that **context-dependent categories (CSRF, IDOR, business-logic abuse, cache deception, CORS misconfiguration) require explicit upstream WAF/application signals** — GhostSOC does not claim to derive them from a raw access log alone.

**MITRE ATT&CK mapping:** `mitre.py` is a **curated dictionary subset** (technique id → name/tactics/URL) covering only the techniques referenced by bundled rules and the web catalog — explicitly documented as not a full ATT&CK mirror.

**Alert → Incident correlation key:** `f"{host_or_ioc}:{technique}:{four_hour_bucket}"` (`services/correlation.py: _correlation_key`) — deterministic, not ML-based.

**Risk scoring formula** (`services/correlation.py: _risk`): `score = SEVERITY_SCORE[top_alert.severity] * 0.55 + max(confidence) * 25 + min(10, (n_alerts-1)*3) + min(20, malicious_iocs*10)`, capped at 100, mapped to `LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL` via thresholds 35/60/80. Reasons are persisted alongside the score in `incident.risk_reasons` (explainability).

|---|---|

| Networks | Default Compose bridge network (no custom `networks:` block defined — **not confirmed** to use a named/isolated network beyond Compose defaults) |
| Volumes | `postgres-data`, `opensearch-data`, `report-data`, `evidence-data` (all named, persistent) |
| Healthchecks | All 4 core services define a `healthcheck:` (pg_isready, curl cluster health, Python urllib GET `/api/v1/health`, wget on `/`) |
| Profiles | `demo`, `full` gate the two demo-runner services; `full` is also referenced by the README as "core + demo runner" |
| Security options | `no-new-privileges:true` on every service |
| Secrets handling | All credentials passed as environment variables with safe local-only defaults (e.g., `POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-ghostsoc-local-only`); `.env.example` documents required overrides |

---

## 17. Infrastructure Architecture

Infrastructure is entirely Docker Compose based — there is no Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes manifest, or Helm chart in the repository. Configuration is centralized in `.env` (from `.env.example`) consumed both by Compose (interpolation) and by the backend's Pydantic `Settings` (`GHOSTSOC_`-prefixed environment variables, `core/config.py`). Persistent state lives in four named Docker volumes (§16). Health/readiness is exposed at `/api/v1/health` (liveness) and `/api/v1/ready` (dependency readiness, checked in `routes.py: readiness`).

## 20. State Machine Diagrams

### 20.1 ResponseAction lifecycle

Directly evidenced by `services/response.py` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`'s documented state machine:

```plantuml
@startuml StateResponseAction
title State Machine — ResponseAction
[*] --> PENDING : create_action()
PENDING --> APPROVED : decide_action(APPROVED) [if approval_required]
PENDING --> DENIED : decide_action(DENIED) [if approval_required]
PENDING --> RUNNING : approval not required
RUNNING --> SUCCESS : real adapter, executed=true & verified=true
RUNNING --> FAILED : no real adapter configured (fail-closed)
PENDING --> DRY_RUN : dry_run=true (default) & no approval required
APPROVED --> DRY_RUN : dry_run=true
APPROVED --> RUNNING : dry_run=false
DENIED --> CANCELLED
DRY_RUN --> [*]
SUCCESS --> [*]
FAILED --> [*]
CANCELLED --> [*]

note right of DRY_RUN
  execution_result.executed = false
  Never marks the incident CONTAINED.
end note
note right of SUCCESS
  Only reachable with a verified,
  non-dry-run adapter result.
  No such adapter exists in this
  codebase today (fails closed).
end note
@enduml
```

### 20.2 Incident lifecycle

`schemas.py` defines the `IncidentStatus` literal type; transitions below are those actually driven by code (`services/response.py`, `api/routes.py: update_incident`):

```plantuml
@startuml StateIncident
title State Machine — Incident
[*] --> NEW : correlate_alert() creates Incident
NEW --> TRIAGED : PATCH /incidents/{id}
TRIAGED --> INVESTIGATING : PATCH, or automatically after a DRY_RUN response
INVESTIGATING --> CONTAINMENT_PENDING : response action requires approval
CONTAINMENT_PENDING --> CONTAINED : verified non-dry-run response success (not currently reachable — no real adapter)
CONTAINMENT_PENDING --> INVESTIGATING : action denied / dry-run only
CONTAINED --> RECOVERING : PATCH /incidents/{id}
RECOVERING --> RESOLVED : PATCH /incidents/{id}
RESOLVED --> CLOSED : PATCH /incidents/{id}
@enduml
```
*(States `RECOVERING`, `RESOLVED`, `CLOSED` are declared in the `IncidentStatus` type and reachable via the generic `PATCH /incidents/{id}` update route, but no dedicated business-rule transition function for them was found beyond direct field update — labeled **inferred** from the schema, not a dedicated state-transition function.)*

### 20.3 AttackDetection lifecycle

```plantuml
@startuml StateAttackDetection
title State Machine — AttackDetection (web security)
[*] --> DETECTED : web_detection creates/aggregates within 15-min window
DETECTED --> CONFIRMED : PATCH /web/attacks/{id} (analyst classification)
DETECTED --> FALSE_POSITIVE : PATCH /web/attacks/{id}
CONFIRMED --> [*]
FALSE_POSITIVE --> [*]
@enduml
```
*(Exact full status enum for `AttackDetection.status` beyond the default `"DETECTED"` was not exhaustively enumerated in this pass — `PATCH /web/attacks/{id}` exists and modifies `status`/`classification`; specific allowed values beyond the default should be confirmed against `web_schemas.py` for a production-grade reference.)*

## 24. Logging & Monitoring Architecture

```plantuml
@startuml LoggingMonitoring
title GhostSOC — Logging & Monitoring Architecture
component "core/logging.py\n(configure_logging)" as LogConfig
component "main.py request_context middleware\n(structured request logs +\nX-Correlation-ID)" as ReqLog
component "Global exception handlers\n(logger.exception on 500s)" as ExcLog
component "services/audit.py\n(AuditLog table: actor, action,\nresult, correlation_id)" as AuditLog
component "Docker healthchecks\n(pg_isready, OpenSearch cluster health,\nGET /api/v1/health, GET /)" as Health
component "GET /api/v1/ready\n(dependency readiness)" as Ready

LogConfig --> ReqLog
ReqLog --> ExcLog
ReqLog ..> AuditLog : correlation_id shared\nfor traceability
Health --> Ready
@enduml
```

- **Application/request logs:** structured, one line per request (`method path -> status in Xms`), tagged with `correlation_id` (`main.py`).
- **Security/audit logs:** persisted `AuditLog` rows (not just text logs) covering actor, action, target, result, correlation ID, and IP — queryable via `GET /api/v1/audit` (permission `VIEW_AUDIT`).
- **Detection logs:** `logger.info`/`logger.warning` in `services/detection.py` (duplicate alert suppression) and `services/search.py` (OpenSearch degradation).
- **No credential/payload logging:** confirmed by design intent in README ("structured logs and request correlation IDs without payload/credential logging") and secret-redaction logic in `web_detection.py`.
- **Search/indexing:** OpenSearch is a logging/search *adapter*, not authoritative; failures are caught and logged as `"DEGRADED"` without failing the request (`services/search.py`).
- **Health/readiness:** `/api/v1/health` (liveness) and `/api/v1/ready` (dependency readiness — checks DB connectivity per `routes.py: readiness`).

## 25. CI/CD Architecture

GitHub Actions CI/CD **is** present (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), with four jobs:

```plantuml
@startuml CICD
title CI/CD Pipeline — GitHub Actions (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
start
fork
  :Job "backend"\nmatrix: Python 3.11/3.12/3.13;
  :pip install -c requirements.lock '.[test]';
  :ruff check app tests alembic/versions;
  :pytest --cov=app --cov-fail-under=85;
  if (python == 3.13?) then (yes)
    :pip-audit -r requirements.lock;
  endif
fork again
  :Job "frontend"\nmatrix: Node 20/22;
  :npm ci;
  :npm run lint;
  :npm run build;
  :npm audit --audit-level=high;
fork again
  :Job "compose-contract";
  :pytest backend/tests/test_compose_contract.py;
fork again
  :Job "release-hygiene";
  :Reject tracked local artifacts\n(.env, .db, node_modules, __pycache__);
  :Secret pattern scan\n(RSA/EC keys, AKIA, ghp_, sk- patterns);
end fork
stop
@enduml
```

Triggers: `push` to `main`/`master` and all `pull_request`s. There is **no separate CD/deployment job** (no cloud deploy step, no container registry push observed) — CI covers correctness/quality/security-hygiene gates only. **Docker build verification is explicitly documented as unverified** in this environment (README: "Docker was not available in the implementation workspace").

---

## 26. Testing Architecture

```plantuml
@startuml TestingArchitecture
title GhostSOC — Testing Architecture
package "backend/tests" {
  [conftest.py\n(fixtures)]
  [test_auth_health.py]
  [test_compose_contract.py]
  [test_config_security.py]
  [test_connectors_cti.py]
  [test_detection_pipeline.py]
  [test_distribution.py]
  [test_response_context.py]
  [test_response_reporting_demo.py]
  [test_visualizations.py]
  [test_web_security.py]
}
component "pytest + pytest-cov\n(coverage gate ≥85%)" as PyTest
component "Ruff (lint)" as Ruff
component "Alembic upgrade/downgrade check\n(make verify)" as AlembicCheck

[test_detection_pipeline.py] --> PyTest
[test_web_security.py] --> PyTest
PyTest --> AlembicCheck : make verify also runs migration round-trip
@enduml
```

11 pytest modules cover: auth/health, Docker Compose contract validation (`test_compose_contract.py` parses `docker-compose.yml` itself), production config-security invariants (`test_config_security.py` — likely exercises the `secure_production_defaults` validator), CTI connector behavior, the Sigma detection pipeline, package/distribution hygiene, response-action context/policy logic, response+reporting demo flow, visualization endpoints, and web security detection. CI enforces **≥85% backend coverage** as a hard gate (`--cov-fail-under=85`). Frontend testing is limited to `npm run lint` and `npm run build` in CI — **a dedicated frontend unit-test runner (e.g., Vitest/Jest) was not found** in `package.json`'s CI-invoked scripts; this should be treated as **not confirmed** rather than assumed present.

## 29. Architecture Decision Analysis

**Observed implementation:** GhostSOC is a layered monolith (API → services → ORM → DB), not microservices; detection/correlation/response run synchronously inside the request/response cycle (no background task queue such as Celery/RQ/Kafka was found); the SSE broker is in-process and explicitly documented as non-authoritative.

**Architectural interpretation:**
- **Separation of concerns** is strong at the module level: routing (`api/`), business logic (`services/`), and persistence (`models.py`) are cleanly separated, and each service module has a narrow, single responsibility (ingestion vs. detection vs. correlation vs. response vs. reporting vs. audit).
- **Modularity** is aided by the declarative `connectors/registry.py` pattern — adding a new external tool boundary is a data entry, not new branching logic — and by the data-driven Sigma rule loader and web attack catalog (rules are YAML/dataclass data, not hard-coded `if` chains for each signature).
- **Scalability** is currently limited by the in-process SSE broker (explicitly documented: "multi-replica production needs a shared broker") and by the synchronous, in-request detection/correlation pipeline (no async worker pool or queue observed) — this is a **reasonable design for a single-instance deployment** but would need rearchitecting (e.g., a message broker or horizontally-shared pub/sub) to scale SSE fan-out across multiple backend replicas.
- **Maintainability** benefits from the project's explicit "truthful status" discipline: connectors that aren't real are never faked healthy, and response actions never silently claim success — this reduces a common class of technical debt (misleading integration status) at the cost of some feature completeness.
- **Security boundaries** are enforced primarily in the backend (RBAC dependency injection on every protected route, target-validation before any response action, SSRF guard on all outbound connector URLs) rather than trusting the frontend — a defensible, standard "never trust the client" architecture.
- **Database design** avoids duplicate/parallel schemas for the endpoint vs. web-security domains: `WebRequest`/`AttackDetection` reuse the same `SecurityEvent`/`Alert`/`Incident` tables rather than maintaining a second incident model — this is a deliberate design decision documented in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` ("intentionally avoids parallel event or incident schemas").
- **Containerization** follows good practice: no direct DB/search host ports, non-root containers, `no-new-privileges`, per-service healthchecks, and Compose profiles to isolate the demo-only containers from the core stack.
- **API design** is a conventional REST/JSON API with a single flat `/api/v1` prefix (spread across three routers) rather than a fully resource-nested or GraphQL API; error responses follow one consistent envelope.
- **Detection architecture** deliberately limits scope (a restricted Sigma subset, a curated MITRE mapping, a fixed 35-category web catalog) rather than attempting a general-purpose SIEM rule engine — this trades generality for predictability and testability (matches the ≥85% coverage gate in CI).

**Recommended improvement (clearly separated from the above, not implemented):**
- Introduce a shared pub/sub (e.g., Redis Streams or a message broker) if the SSE broker needs to scale beyond one backend replica.
- Consider moving detection/correlation off the synchronous request path into a background worker for high ingest volumes, to bound event-ingestion API latency.
- Add a frontend unit-test suite (Vitest/Jest + React Testing Library) alongside the existing lint/build CI gate, since none was found.
- If a real response-execution adapter is ever added, keep the current fail-closed default and require an explicit, audited opt-in per environment (consistent with existing `dry_run`/`demo_mode` production guardrails).

## 30. Design Pattern / SOLID Analysis

| Pattern | Location | Evidence | Purpose | Benefit | Possible problem |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Service Layer** | `backend/app/services/*.py` | Each business capability (ingestion, detection, correlation, response, reporting, audit, investigation, search, realtime) is a dedicated module with plain functions taking a `Session` | Encapsulate business logic outside route handlers | Testable in isolation from HTTP; reusable across routers | Functions (not classes) — less "textbook" OOP service objects, but idiomatic for this FastAPI/SQLAlchemy style |
| **Repository-like data access** | SQLAlchemy `Session` used directly in services (no dedicated repository classes) | e.g., `db.scalar(select(Incident).where(...))` throughout `correlation.py`, `response.py` | Query encapsulation | — | This is **not** a strict Repository Pattern (no repository interface/class abstraction) — direct ORM/session use in services. Do not overclaim a Repository Pattern here. |
| **Dependency Injection** | FastAPI `Depends(...)` | `api/dependencies.py`: `DbSession`, `CurrentUser`, `require_permission(...)` | Inject DB session and authenticated/authorized user into route handlers | Testable, declarative per-route authorization | — |
| **Registry / Declarative configuration** | `connectors/registry.py` | `DEFINITIONS: list[ConnectorDefinition]` iterated by `list_connectors()` | Central declarative inventory of 20 connectors instead of per-connector branching code | Easy to add/audit connectors; consistent health-state modeling | — |
| **Strategy-like dispatch** | `services/detection.py: _value_matches()` (modifier-based matching: `contains`/`startswith`/`endswith`/equality) | Same function branches by modifier string | Pluggable match strategies per Sigma field modifier | Simple, data-driven | Implemented as `if/elif` branching rather than a formal Strategy class hierarchy — a lightweight, appropriate choice for 4 modifiers, not a full GoF Strategy pattern |
| **Middleware / Chain of Responsibility** | `main.py: request_context`, `CORSMiddleware`, three `@app.exception_handler` decorators | ASGI middleware chain + exception handler chain | Cross-cutting concerns (correlation ID, headers, logging, uniform error shape) | Centralized, consistent behavior across all routes | — |
| **Idempotent Command** | `services/response.py: create_action()` keyed by `idempotency_key` | Unique DB constraint + existing-row short-circuit | Prevent duplicate response-action execution on retry | Safe retries from the client | — |
| **Fail-closed guard** | `services/response.py`, `services/investigation.py` | Any real (non-dry-run/non-demo) execution path explicitly returns `FAILED`/`503` rather than attempting an unimplemented action | Security-by-default | Prevents false claims of success/containment | — |

**Patterns explicitly NOT found and not claimed:** Factory (no factory classes for models/services were found), classic Observer (the SSE broker is a simple pub/sub queue structure, not a formal Observer interface hierarchy), Singleton (the one arguable candidate, `live_broker` as a module-level instance, is a plain global, not a guarded Singleton class), Adapter (the connector modules resemble adapters conceptually but are implemented as plain classes/functions, not a formalized `Adapter` interface layer), Facade (no single facade class was found unifying subsystems — routers call services directly). MVC in the traditional sense does not apply cleanly since this is a headless API + separate SPA, not a server-rendered MVC app; it's more accurately described as **API layer / Service layer / Data layer**.

---

## 31. Architecture Strengths

1. Backend-enforced RBAC and target validation — the UI cannot be the only gate.
2. Deterministic, auditable detection and correlation (no opaque ML step) — easy to explain in a SOC context.
3. Explicit, code-enforced "truthful status" for every external integration (health boundary vs. bundled).
4. Fail-closed response execution by default (`dry_run=true`), with idempotency and policy/target validation before anything happens.
5. Clean separation of concerns across API/service/data layers; no parallel/duplicate schemas for web vs. endpoint domains.
6. Strong CI hygiene: lint + ≥85% backend coverage + compose-contract test + secret-pattern scan + dependency audit.
7. Container hardening: non-root images, no direct DB/search host ports, `no-new-privileges`.

## 32. Architecture Weaknesses

1. SSE broker is in-process only — does not horizontally scale across multiple backend replicas (documented limitation).
2. Detection/correlation execute synchronously in the request path — no background worker/queue for higher-volume ingestion.
3. Sigma-rule subset is intentionally restrictive (no parenthesized/negated conditions) — real-world Sigma rule libraries would need translation/rewriting.
4. MITRE ATT&CK metadata is a curated subset, not a full technique database.
5. No frontend automated test suite was found (lint/build only in CI).
6. No Kubernetes/cloud IaC — single-host Docker Compose only, which caps availability/scale without external orchestration.

## 33. Security Considerations

Covered in depth in §14. Summary: JWT + Argon2id auth, backend RBAC, SSRF-safe outbound connector validation, response-action target allowlisting, secret redaction on web telemetry, uniform structured error responses, and hardened container defaults, all matching the project's own `docs/SECURITY.md` framing (file present but not further excerpted here beyond what code confirms).

## 34. Scalability Considerations

Vertical scaling of the single backend/Postgres/OpenSearch stack is straightforward (resource limits, `OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS` heap sizing observed in compose). Horizontal scaling of the backend is constrained today by the in-process SSE broker; PostgreSQL remains the single source of truth so read replicas/connection pooling would be the natural next scaling lever, and OpenSearch's optionality (best-effort, non-blocking) means search capacity can degrade without breaking core functionality — a resilience-oriented design choice.

## 35. Maintainability Considerations

The declarative connector registry, data-driven Sigma/web-catalog rule loading, single error-envelope convention, and ≥85%-coverage CI gate all reduce the cost of future changes. The explicit distinction between `REAL`, `REAL_LOCAL`, `REAL_BOUNDARY`, `LOCAL_OPTIONAL`, and `DOCUMENTED` connector modes (`connectors/registry.py`) is a maintainability strength: it prevents "silent scope creep" where a partially-built integration gets treated as production-ready.

## 36. Recommended Improvements

*(Clearly separated from observed/implemented — see also §29.)*
1. Add a shared broker (Redis Streams, NATS, etc.) if/when SSE needs multi-replica fan-out.
2. Introduce an async task runner for detection/correlation if ingestion volume grows beyond what synchronous request handling can absorb.
3. Add frontend automated tests (unit + integration) to match backend coverage discipline.
4. If real response execution is ever implemented, preserve the current fail-closed, policy-gated, idempotent design and add a dedicated audited "adapter verification" step before allowing `CONTAINED` status.
5. Consider container-orchestration (Kubernetes) manifests only if multi-host deployment becomes a requirement; the current Compose-only approach is appropriate for the project's stated single-host scope.

## 38. Accuracy Notes (per the "never hallucinate" requirement)

- The originally-requested repository name (`GhostSOCadvanced`) does not exist; this document analyzes the confirmed, real repository `Dhrona1421/GhostSOC`.
- **No Kubernetes, Kafka, Redis, message queue, or background worker system was found** anywhere in the codebase — detection/correlation/response run synchronously inside FastAPI request handlers. Do not assume these exist in any downstream use of this document.
- **JWT authentication is implemented** (HS256, PyJWT) — confirmed, not assumed.
- **OAuth is not implemented** — only first-party email/password login with Argon2id + JWT was found.
- **Real, executed response/containment actions are not implemented** — every non-dry-run path deterministically fails closed. This is a core, load-bearing fact about the system and should not be described as "the system can block/isolate/quarantine in production" without this caveat.
- **MITRE ATT&CK integration is real but partial** — a curated technique subset, not a full ATT&CK corpus mirror.
- Items marked *(inferred)* or *(not confirmed from repository)* above (e.g., exact `AttackDetection.status` enum values beyond the default, precise frontend build-tooling test runner, hosting/cloud target) should be re-verified directly against `web_schemas.py`/`package.json` before being treated as final for a graded submission or external audit.
